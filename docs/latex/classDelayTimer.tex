\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
A simulation of delay timer found in chip8 architecture. 

A very common need in game development is to count time remaining until some event occurs. In chip8 architecture, this functionality is realized with a special data register -\/ delay timer. As it is the case with regular registers, you can store an 8-\/bit value in it. The difference is that delay timer will perpetually count down at a rate of 60 Hz untill it reaches 0.

\mbox{\hyperlink{classDelayTimer}{Delay\+Timer}} is responsible for delivering this functionality. You can store a value by calling Delay\+Timer\+::store and later read it by calling \mbox{\hyperlink{classDelayTimer_ae3f97b584a98993ad1744c83d4c22d5c}{Delay\+Timer\+::read}}.

Read value of delay timer. 

Under the hood, instead of decrementing registers\textquotesingle{} value by 1 every 1/60 second, it stores the value once, and at each read returns the value stored minus interval between last store timepoint and now, represented in 60 Hz ticks.
