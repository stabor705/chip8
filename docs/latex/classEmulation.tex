\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
A glue that combines everything together. 

This emulator program is really comprised from 2 subsystems.
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The chip8 emulation logic represented by \mbox{\hyperlink{classChip8}{Chip8}} class. It allows to parse and execute instructions without any knowledge of how input is delivered from user and how output is displayed to user. Its whole interface is programmatic.
\item The user interface represented by \mbox{\hyperlink{classUserInterface}{User\+Interface}} class -\/ a system that initializes graphics, creates window, processes user input, draws GUI, properly draws game display using pixel matrix provided by \mbox{\hyperlink{classDisplay}{Display}} class.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

There is a need to tie it all together and run in loop. Most importantly, in order to get good performence, we can\textquotesingle{}t tick these subsystems with same frequency. Program instructions should be run multiple times befere the display is redrawn. Ideally, we would run program instructions until display has beed changed. This, however, would produce cpu-\/bound emulation speed and would probably run too fast on most computers. Thus, \mbox{\hyperlink{classEmulation}{Emulation}} also takes care of keeping an upper bound on rendered frames per second.

\mbox{\hyperlink{classEmulation}{Emulation}} also extracts data from \mbox{\hyperlink{classChip8}{Chip8}} and transmits it to \mbox{\hyperlink{classUserInterface}{User\+Interface}}, taking care of communication between these two.

In order to run program, you just have to call Emulation\+::run method. Rest can be taken care of by GUI.
